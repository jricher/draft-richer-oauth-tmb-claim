                     Deferred Key Binding for OAuth
                  draft-richer-oauth-tmb-claim-latest

Abstract

   Sometimes you want to get a token that's tied to a public key but you
   can't prove possession of that public key.  That's when you need to
   trust me, bruh.

1.  Introduction

   The JWT confirmation claim "cnf" [RFC7800] allows an RS to determine
   PoP semantics for a token.  However, methods like mTLS [RFC8705] and
   DPoP [RFC9449] assume that the requester of that token can prove
   possession of the key that is bound to the token.  Sometimes that's
   just too hard, and so here we define a claim to allow a requester to
   ask for a token that is bound to a key that the requester cannot,
   does not want to, or does not feel like proving possession of at the
   time of request.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Token Meta-key Binding Claim

   The token meta-key binding "tmb" claim is passed in an OAuth token
   request parameter of the same name.  Its value is the form-encoded
   value that the requester wants the confirmation claim to be in the
   issued token.  If the requester is making a DPoP or mTLS request, any
   keys there MUST be ignored.

   The same parameter can be used in a token exchange request, with the
   same results.

   If the issued token is a JWT, the value of the "tmb" claim is copied
   to the "cnf" claim of the resulting token.  If the token is
   introspected, the value of "tmb" is returned in the "cnf" claim of
   the introspection response.

   The requester SHOULD give the resulting token to the holder of the
   key represented in the "tmb" claim.

   The presenter of the token MUST prove possession of the key in the
   resulting "cnf" claim using the appropriate key validation method for
   the type of token.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security of this specification is entirely based on trust.  If
   you have trust issues, it's not going to be secure.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the "tmb" claim to the IANA JWT Claims
   registry and OAuth request parameter.
